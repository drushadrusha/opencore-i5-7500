# OpenCore EFI i5-7500

Big Sur with working HD 630 acceleration. Working flawlessly.

This repo is just backup of mine configuration. It might not work on your setup.

## My setup:

|  * | model |
|---|---|
| Motherboard  | MSI B250M PRO-VD  |
| CPU  | i5-7500  |
| Graphics |  HD 630 |

Sound is not configured since i have external sound card.
